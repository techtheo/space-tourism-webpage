## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS utility classes
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

The use of custom properties and utily classes together makes the job so easy in the long run.

I should, and definately will, use more properties like "clamp" and "min-max" in the future. It makes creating responsive layouts more easy.

It was amazing to learn some tricks on accessibility and how to make the page screen-reader friendly and easy to navigate using TAB key.

Working with grid-areas is a great way to organize the layout.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell Space Travel course](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) - This challanged had a video guide made with association with Kevin Powell, who is a great teacher and really knows what he's doing. I had a lot of amazing insights while learning and coding, and was able to adapt my CSS with cleaner code.
